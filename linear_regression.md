### What are the assumptions of Linear Regression?

The assumptions of Linear Regression are as follows:
1. **Linear Relationship** - The relationship between the independent and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. This can be tested using scatter plots.

2. **Multivariate Normality** - Regression requires all variables to be normally distributed.

3. **Multicollinearity** - There is no multicollinearity between independent features. We can use correlation matrix to determine this.

4. **Homoscedasticity** - The error term is same across all values of the independent features.
