### Descriptive Statistics

The study of numerical and graphical ways to describe and display the data is called Descriptive Statistics. In descriptive statistics we usually take sample into account.
3 important dimensions of describing data are:

**1. Central Tendency of Data -**
* mean - affected by outliers
* median - not affected by outliers
* mode - not affected by outliers

**2. Dispersion of Data -**
* IQR (Q3 - Q1)
Q1 is the 25th percentile of the data
Q2 is the 50th percentile of the data (also called median)
Q3 is the 75th percentile of the data
The advantage of using IQR is that it is robust to outliers and can hence help in the detection of the outliers. 

* Range(Max-Min)
* Standard Deviation - square root of the variance
We can have the standard deviation of sample and the standard deviation of the population

* Variance - the average sqaured deviation from the mean.

**3. Shape of the Data**

The shape of the data helps in making a decision regarding the probability of the data. It can be measured as:
* Symmetric - the data is distributed the same on both sides, the mean and median are close to each other
* Skewness - the data is asymmetric. It can either be **Positive Skewed** or **Negative Skewed**. 
In positively skewed data, the data is clustered on the left side, whereas in negatively skewed data, the data is clustered on the right side. 

The most commonly used method of calculating skewness is
*skewness = 3 * (mean - median)/std dev*

* Kurtosis - The data can be distributed in 3 ways:
**PlatyKurtic** - very flat tails
**MesoKurtic** - normal distribution
**LeptoKurtic** - very closely spaced

### Inferential Statistics

Using a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population is called Inferential Statistics.
